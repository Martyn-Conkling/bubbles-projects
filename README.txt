The purpose of these projects is to explore some bubbles simulations
and learn about the p5.js library through building fun object oriented projects

Bubbles are a fun object to simulate as their movements through the air can be influenced by wind currents, as well as gravity
They can also pop, or bounce off other bubbles.
